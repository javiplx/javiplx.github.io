As kubernetes people [dislike taken context or namespace from environment variables](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27308),
using tools as [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx/blob/master/README.md) for comfortable context switching might become a must.
In that path, showing some [kubernetes environment values on prompt](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1/blob/master/README.md) is likely also useful
